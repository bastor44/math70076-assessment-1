## Project Description
This project was created as an assessment for MATH70076 Data Science at Imperial College London in February 2025. The data was gathered from the UK voter registration performance dashboard (https://www.registertovote.service.gov.uk/performance). The style guidelines were those provided by The Dallas Morning News (DMN) (https://policyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tdmn_graphics.pdf). Brief analysis was performed on voter registration numbers from 2024 in R and a single page graphic and article were created with LaTeX.
